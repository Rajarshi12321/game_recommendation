As that leader in your game, you will face the dual threats of ice and zombies, implement survival strategies, solve puzzles, rebuild your home, and safeguard the lives of survivors.

com.HoYoverse.Nap,Zenless Zone Zero,"Don't go into Hollows.
I know, I know, there are Ether resources in the Hollows, bizarre creations, even ruins of the old civilization — all invaluable treasures.
But don't forget about the spatial disorder, the monsters, and mutants running rampant. Ultimately, this is a disaster that could swallow the world. Hollows are not where ordinary people should go.
So don't go into Hollows.
Or at least, don't go in alone.
If you insist on getting into danger, go to New Eridu first.
This city full of people from all walks of life has many who need the Hollows: powerful and wealthy tycoons, gangs who rule the streets, schemers hiding in the shadows, and ruthless officials.
Make your preparations there, find strong allies, and most importantly—
Find a ""Proxy.""
Only they can guide people out of labyrinthian Hollows.
Good luck.

Zenless Zone Zero is an all-new 3D action game from HoYoverse that takes place in a near future, with the world plagued by a mysterious disaster known as ""Hollows.""

Dual identities, a singular experience
In the near future, a mysterious natural disaster known as ""Hollows"" has occurred. A new kind of city has emerged in this disaster-ridden world — New Eridu. This last oasis has mastered the technology to co-exist with Hollows and is home to a whole host of chaotic, boisterous, dangerous, and very active factions. As a professional Proxy, you play a crucial role in linking the city and the Hollows. Your story awaits.
 
Build your squad and fight fast-paced battles
Zenless Zone Zero is an all-new 3D action game from HoYoverse, here to provide a thrilling combat experience. Build a squad of up to three and begin your assault with Basic and Special Attacks. Dodge and Parry to neutralize your opponents' counterattacks, and when they're Stunned, unleash a powerful combo of Chain Attacks to finish them off! Remember, different opponents have different traits, and it would be prudent to use their weaknesses to your advantage.
 
Immerse yourself in the unique style and music
Zenless Zone Zero has a unique visual style and design. With its carefully crafted character expressions and fluid movements, you'll easily feel immersed in the fascinating world as you embark on your own journey~ And of course, every VIP deserves their very own soundtrack, so you'll also have emotional beats full of drip to accompany you in each unforgettable moment~
 
Various factions and stories entwined
Random Play can't operate without videotapes, and Proxies can't operate without Agents. In New Eridu, customers from all walks will come knocking. So don't be fooled by their innocent and cute appearances, don't be afraid of those who tower over you and look dangerous, and don't turn away the fluffy ones who might shed fur all over your spotless floor. Go and talk with them, learn about their unique experiences, and allow them to become your friends and allies. After all, this is a long path, and only with companions will you be able to walk far~

Bowl against the best!

How do you think you’d fare against the cool confidence and pin-point accuracy of Walter Ray Williams, Jr. or the brash power stroke of Pete Weber? How would your scores stand up against the high spin and smooth release of Norm Duke or the high cranking backswing of Parker Bohn III. Based on actual statistics that track their power, hook, and control, PBA Bowling Challenge strives to accurately recreate the skill and style of the top bowlers in the sport today.


Split Ball, Bomb Ball, and more!

They may not be tournament legal in the real world, but these special balls can really help you out in a tough tournament.

If the lane seems too big and your ball seems too small, the Lightning Ball’s swirling storm of electricity is sure to hit something!

____________________________________

Drifting is the act of maneuvering a vehicle through corners at speeds and angles that exceed the vehicle’s grip. A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.

It’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!

com.coffeestainstudios.goatsimulator,Goat Simulator,"Goat Simulator is the latest in goat simulation technology, bringing next-gen goat simulation to YOU. You no longer have to fantasize about being a goat, your dreams have finally come true!

Gameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat. It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game.

<b>DISCLAIMER</b>
Goat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.

<b>KEY FEATURES</b>
• You can be a goat 
• Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat 
• MILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs, everything else is hilarious and we're keeping it 
• In-game physics that bug out all the time 
• Seriously look at that goat's neck 
• You can be a goat

com.elevenbitstudios.twommobile,This War of Mine,"The Little Ones expansion is available now as an in-app purchase!

""If you've not already played this brilliant, heart-wrenching game, then mobile is as good a place as any to let it completely destroy you."" - , 9/10, Pocket Gamer UK

""This War of Mine isn’t exactly “fun,” but it’s definitely a game worth playing."" , 9/10, 148apps

In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. 

The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. 

Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.

Key Features:
•    Inspired by real-life events 
•    Control your survivors and manage your shelter 
•    Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive 
•    Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience 
•    Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game 
•    Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme

The Little Ones:

The newly delivered expansion explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective―that of a child. This DLC puts you in charge of a group of adults and children stuck in a besieged city, struggling with basic necessities. TWoM: The Little Ones focuses not only on the reality of enduring war, but also on how even in times of conflict, kids are still kids: they laugh, cry, play, and see the world differently. In addition to thinking about survival, you'll have to summon your inner child to understand how to protect the little ones. Their youth, and their future, are in your hands.

• Experience the biggest expansion to This War of Mine
• Protect innocent children
• Craft toys, play with kids, and be the caretaker they need
• Meet new adult civilians in scenarios with children

com.khg.doorkickers,Door Kickers,"The unforgiving, award-winning SWAT tactics and strategy game.

***RockPaperShotgun’s 'Bestest Best Tactics game' award***

***“Door Kickers is a game about cops kicking down doors, and these doors are a lot of fun to kick down. It is also very hard, and I love it for that.” ***
84/100 – PC Gamer

***”It evokes lot of the more demanding thrills that modern games have left behind, the grit and the hard won satisfaction of overcoming intimidating challenges, or the experimental fun of spending hours tinkering with all the different ways you can play through a big, open-ended level. I had a blast inching my way through pretty much all of the harder stages in this game and I also think you might have a blast with it too.” ***
Super Bunnyhop

***“It’s a thing of beauty and manages to capture the planning and satisfying execution of more complex strategy games, as well as the gung-ho and the popping-off of growly man in military shooters. (...) It’s probably the best man-shootery game I’ve played in years.”***
Indie Statik


Door Kickers mixes old school, no-quarter action/strategy with modern ergonomic interfaces and puts you in command of a SWAT team during a tactical intervention.
Analyze the situation, plan team routes, choose equipment and breach points, and coordinate multiple troopers to reach the hostage room before the bad guys get to press that trigger.
Includes a new campaign, as well as full cross-platform saves compatibility and an all-new interface designed specifically for touch based platforms.

It may sound daunting, and like real world CQB combat, it sure is. But most levels can be completed in minutes and on the fly improvisation works. Achieving the perfect planning, getting the mission done with no false steps and losing no people, that’s a skill harder to master.
Quick Points:
§ 80 single missions, 6 campaigns and unlimited gameplay via mission generator
§ Over 65 weapons and gear items to use and overcome the enemy.
§ Top Down perspective for optimal strategic analysis
§ Real Time With Free Pause
§ No turns, no hexes, no action points or awkward interfaces
§ Realistic but action packed
§ Non-linear levels, freeform strategy

Life starts when you sprout, time goes by with every step you take, and you can set your pace at any moment. You live and learn: surround yourself with other turnips and interact with them to forge your personality. Your acquired strengths and weaknesses will affect your future interactions.

Build your social circle by maintaining and caring for the relationships that matter the most to you, and run away from the ones that don't. You can adopt many radish-pets and spend your life with them, start a family and breed little turnips or live fast and die young. There are thousands of ways to live and none is correct! Just live as you wish! (and assume the consequences of your decisions when you rot).

Living and thriving in social relationships is not easy, so Minabo - A walk through life offers collectible hats that produce different effects when worn. Easily falling in love, making everyone hate you, getting an elegance plus or even changing your life expectancy...

In Minabo - A walk through life, no two lives are the same and when they end, every one of them will generate a summary that you can share with your friends.

What would you change from your past? What would life have been if you weren't rude to that one friend of your childhood? What if you spent more time with your family? Minabo - A walk through life will allow you to discover the answers if you decide to go back in time instead of starting a new life.

Main features:

- 25 quests with dozens of goals to make every life a challenge.
- Free life mode: Each life and character is randomly generated. No two lives are the same!
- Explore interpersonal relationships and build your social circle. Realistic relationships counselled by psychologists!

Sit on the throne as a benevolent (or malevolent) medieval monarch of the modern age and swipe your royal fingers either left or right to impose your will upon the kingdom. Survive the seemingly never-ending gauntlet of requests from your advisors, peasants, allies, and enemies while maintaining balance between the influential factions of your kingdom. But beware; each decision you make might have implications and unfortunate consequences down the road that could put your reign and family’s dynasty at risk!

Each year of your reign brings another important – seemingly random – request from your unpredictable kingdom as you strive for balance between the church, the people, the army, and the treasury. Prudent decisions and careful planning make for a long reign but unforeseen motivations, surprise events, and poor luck can take down even the most entrenched monarch. Extend your reign as long as possible, forge alliances, make enemies, and find new ways to die as your dynasty marches along through the ages. Some events will span on centuries, with an intrigue involving burning witches, scientific enlightenment, wicked politics and, maybe, the Devil himself.","Swipe left, swipe right, be the King.","1,000,000+",4.37,147866.0,DevolverDigital,"[{'name': 'Adventure', 'id': 'GAME_ADVENTURE'}, {'name': 'Interactive story', 'id': None}, {'name': 'Casual', 'id': 'GAME_CASUAL'}, {'name': 'Stylized', 'id': None}, {'name': 'Low poly', 'id': None}]",https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/V_GWB0meXuP9pojlPIfbbXkB6dM_h-xOW9kt8buazk-D8U0D9teIWVzrotJI8J0aArQ,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/mi7Tx_L6egQlxg17GVJD1h1YM3XfTEVEDqsaDyY4IQeMf7ebJ_hoesS636J_QdT6AZg,Rated for 12+,Mild Swearing,"Aug 10, 2016","Oct 12, 2023",1,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devolver.reigns&hl=en&gl=in
